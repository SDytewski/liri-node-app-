# liri-node-app-

To use the Spotify API with Node.JS, we type: 

node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'



This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window


Artist(s)
The song's name
A preview link of the song from Spotify
The album that the song is from


If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.






Typing:


 "node liri.js do-what-it-says" 
 
 into the terminal will read the random.txt file and perform whatever command is in the text file.  Currently I am referenecing the "movie-this" command and a name of a movie.  I could put "spotify-this-song" and a name of a song and it would show that information in the terminal.
